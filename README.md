Understanding the Requirements
Lockdown Mode: Restrict the device to only allow essential apps and services, disabling all others deemed unnecessary.
Essential Components:
Screen Wakeup (Launcher) App: The default home screen app (e.g., system launcher or a custom launcher like Nova Launcher).
Authentication App and Services: Apps and services handling authentication, such as Google Play Services for OAuth, device lock screen authentication, or specific apps like Authy or Google Authenticator.
Magisk Module: A module that leverages Magisk’s systemless modification capabilities to achieve this without permanently altering the system partition.
Enable/Disable: The module should provide a mechanism to toggle this lockdown mode on or off.
Feasibility and Challenges
Magisk’s Capabilities: Magisk allows systemless modifications, including running scripts, modifying system properties, and overlaying files. It’s ideal for this task as it can manipulate app states and services without triggering SafetyNet or breaking OTA updates.
Disabling Apps/Services: Android allows disabling apps and services via the pm (Package Manager) and am (Activity Manager) commands, or by modifying system configurations. However, identifying “unnecessary” apps/services is subjective and device-dependent.
Preserving Essentials: Ensuring the launcher and authentication services remain functional requires careful allowlisting and testing to avoid breaking core functionality (e.g., lock screen or system UI).
Security and Stability: Improperly disabling system apps or services can lead to boot loops, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.
User Control: The module should include a toggle mechanism (e.g., via a script, app, or terminal command) to enable/disable lockdown mode.
